# Adding External Code

If you want to use your own Python modules or scripts in Jupyter notebooks, follow these steps to upload them easily.

## 1. Prepare your external code

Organize your external code and follow Python packaging best practices. Set up the right folder structure, add an `__init__.py` file, and list any required dependencies.

**Suggested Directory Structure:**

```text
src/
|-- celltrackscolab/
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- my_script.py
|   |-- subpackage/
|       |-- __init__.py
```

### What goes in `__init__.py`?

Think of `__init__.py` as the file that tells Python “this folder is a package”.

 If you leave it empty, that is perfectly fine—the package will still import correctly. When you want to make notebooks feel friendlier, you can re-export helper functions so users can discover them more easily:

```python
# src/celltrackscolab/__init__.py
from .my_script import run_analysis, load_config

__all__ = ["run_analysis", "load_config"]
```

Each folder that you plan to import (for example, `src/subpackage/`) should also have its own `__init__.py`. Keep it empty unless you want to expose selected helpers from that subpackage.

If you need further readings on `__init__.py`, check out this quick [Geeks for Geeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/what-is-__init__-py-file-in-python/) or the [Real Python guide](https://realpython.com/python-init-py/).
## 2. Upload your external code to the repository

Go to the src folder in your repository and upload your files or folders there.

## 3. How to import into your notebook

Once uploaded, your external code will be available to your notebooks as a package. To use it, import it as shown in the examples below:

**Import the whole package:**
```python  
import celltrackscolab
```

If your folder under `src/` is called `celltools`, then `import celltools` will work because `src/celltools/__init__.py` exists.

**Import function:**
```python  
from celltrackscolab import my_script
```

**Import submodule:**
```python  
from celltrackscolab.subpackage import submodule1
```

## 4. Publish the code on PyPI (optional)

The installer always puts your package into the app. You can also publish it on [PyPI](https://pypi.org), so that anyone can install it with `pip install`, in Google Colab or in their own Python. Each release then does both, with the same version: the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/publish_pypi.yml` builds the package and uploads it when you publish a release, next to the installers.

It is **off until you turn it on**, and GitHub stores no password or token for it: PyPI trusts this repository's workflow directly ([trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/)).

**What is published**

| | |
|---|---|
| Name | The `name=` of `setup.py`: the name of the package, given when the repository was initialised (unless you changed it). If `labconstrictor-app.yaml` has `distribution.pip`, it must be the same name. |
| Version | The release tag without the `v`: release `v1.2.0` publishes 1.2.0. |
| Code | Every package in `src/` (a folder with an `__init__.py`). |
| Dependencies | Each line of `requirements.txt`, as it is written (exact versions included). Options (`-r`, `--extra-index-url`), paths and URLs are left out, with a warning in the log: PyPI refuses dependencies given as URLs. |
| Description | `README.md` of the repository, shown on the PyPI page. |
| License | The `LICENSE` file. |

### One-time setup

1. **Check that the name is free.** Open `https://pypi.org/project/<name>/`. A "404 Not Found" page means nobody uses it. If it is taken, change `name=` in `setup.py` (and `distribution.pip`) and commit.
2. **Register this workflow on PyPI.** Log in to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org) (create an account if you have none; PyPI asks for two-factor authentication). Open your account menu > **Your projects** > **Publishing** ([pypi.org/manage/account/publishing](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/)). Under **Add a new pending publisher**, choose the **GitHub** tab. The form has five fields; fill them in exactly:
   - **PyPI Project Name:** the name of the package.
   - **Owner:** the GitHub user or organisation that owns the repository (`CellMigrationLab` in `github.com/CellMigrationLab/MyApp`).
   - **Repository name:** the repository (`MyApp`).
   - **Workflow name:** `publish_pypi.yml`
   - **Environment name:** `pypi`

   Click **Add**. The publisher appears under **Pending publishers** below the form. It does not reserve the name: the project is created by your first release. If the project already exists on PyPI and you own it, add the publisher in the project instead: **Your projects** > the project > **Manage** > **Publishing**.
3. **Turn it on in GitHub.** In the repository, open **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**, then the **Variables** tab (not **Secrets**: a secret cannot turn a workflow on). Click **New repository variable**, type `PYPI_PUBLISH` as the name and `true` as the value, and click **Add variable**.
4. **Publish a release** as usual ([Create executable installers](executable_creation.md)). In the **Actions** tab, the workflow **Publish the Python package to PyPI** runs next to **Build Release Installers**. When both jobs are green, the package is at `https://pypi.org/project/<name>/`. The upload job shows the link too.

### Try it on TestPyPI first (optional)

[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org) is a separate copy of PyPI for trials, with its own account. Add the same pending publisher at [test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing](https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/), give the variable `PYPI_PUBLISH` the value `testpypi`, and publish a release. Install the result with:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ <name>
```

Then change the variable to `true`: the next release goes to PyPI.

### Turn it off

Delete the variable `PYPI_PUBLISH` (**Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > **Variables**). The workflow stays in the repository and is skipped at each release (a grey icon in the **Actions** tab, not a failure). What was published stays on PyPI.

### Good to know

- **A version can be uploaded only once**, even after it was deleted from PyPI. The workflow checks this before it builds anything and stops with a clear message; to publish a fix, make a new release with a higher version.
- **The release writes its version into `setup.py`** (the "Update version" commit of the release workflow), so the file and PyPI agree.
- **To approve each upload by hand**, open **Settings** > **Environments** > **pypi** (GitHub creates it at the first run) and add **Required reviewers**.
- **A repository that already publishes to PyPI with a workflow of its own** does not get `publish_pypi.yml` from the template update, so nothing is uploaded twice. See [the design note of template 0.1.25](https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/LabConstrictor/blob/main/.tools/docs/migration_0_1_25.md).
