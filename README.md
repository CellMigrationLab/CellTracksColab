> In life sciences, tracking objects from movies is pivotal in quantifying the behavior of single particles, organelles, bacteria, cells, and even whole animals. While numerous tools allow automated tracking from video, a significant challenge remains in compiling, analyzing, and exploring the vast datasets generated. **CellTracksColab** is here to bridge this gap.
