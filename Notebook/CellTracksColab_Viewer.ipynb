A higher p-value suggests a greater likelihood that the distributions are similar.\n","\n","#### Interpreting the Heatmap\n","- **Color Coding:** The heatmap uses a color gradient (from viridis) to represent the range of p-values. Darker colors indicate higher p-values.\n","- **P-Value Thresholds:**\n","  - **High P-Values (Lighter Areas):** Indicate that the downsampling process likely did not significantly alter the distribution of that numerical column for the specific condition-repeat group.\n","  - **Low P-Values (Darker Areas):** Suggest that the downsampling process may have affected the distribution significantly.\n","- **Varying P-Values:** Variations in color across different columns and rows help identify which specific numerical columns and condition-repeat groups are most affected by the downsampling.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"LUGDFw62QCbd"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from scipy.stats import ks_2samp\n","\n","# @title ##Check if your downsampling has affected your data distribution\n","\n","def calculate_ks_p_value(df1, df2, column):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Calculate the KS p-value for a given column between two dataframes.\n","\n","    Parameters:\n","    df1 (pandas.DataFrame): Original DataFrame.\n","    df2 (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame after downsampling.\n","    column (str): Column name to compare.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","    float: KS p-value.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    return ks_2samp(df1[column].dropna(), df2[column].dropna())[1]\n","\n","# Identify numerical columns\n","numerical_columns = merged_tracks_df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns\n","\n","# Initialize a DataFrame to store KS p-values\n","ks_p_values = pd.DataFrame(columns=numerical_columns)\n","\n","# Iterate over each group and numerical column\n","for group, group_df in merged_tracks_df.groupby(['Condition', 'Repeat']):\n","    group_p_values = []\n","    balanced_group_df = balanced_merged_tracks_df[(balanced_merged_tracks_df['Condition'] == group[0]) & (balanced_merged_tracks_df['Repeat'] == group[1])]\n","    for column in numerical_columns:\n","        p_value = calculate_ks_p_value(group_df, balanced_group_df, column)\n","        group_p_values.append(p_value)\n","    ks_p_values.loc[f'Condition: {group[0]}, Repeat: {group[1]}'] = group_p_values\n","\n","# Maximum number of columns per heatmap\n","max_columns_per_heatmap = 20\n","\n","# Total number of columns\n","total_columns = len(ks_p_values.columns)\n","\n","# Calculate the number of heatmaps needed\n","num_heatmaps = -(-total_columns // max_columns_per_heatmap)  # Ceiling division\n","\n","# File path for the PDF\n","pdf_filepath = Results_Folder+'/Balanced_dataset/p-Value Heatmap.pdf'\n","\n","# Create a PDF file\n","with PdfPages(pdf_filepath) as pdf:\n","    # Loop through each subset of columns and create a heatmap\n","    for i in range(num_heatmaps):\n","        start_col = i * max_columns_per_heatmap\n","        end_col = min(start_col + max_columns_per_heatmap, total_columns)\n","\n","        # Subset of columns for this heatmap\n","        subset_columns = ks_p_values.columns[start_col:end_col]\n","\n","        # Create the heatmap for the subset of columns\n","        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\n","        sns.heatmap(ks_p_values[subset_columns], cmap='viridis', vmax=0.5, vmin=0)\n","        plt.title(f'Kolmogorov-Smirnov P-Value Heatmap (Columns {start_col+1} to {end_col})')\n","        plt.xlabel('Numerical Columns')\n","        plt.ylabel('Condition-Repeat Groups')\n","        plt.tight_layout()\n","\n","        # Save the current figure to the PDF\n","        pdf.savefig()\n","        plt.show()\n","        plt.close()\n","\n","print(f\"Saved all heatmaps to {pdf_filepath}\")\n","\n","# Save the p-values to a CSV file\n","ks_p_values.to_csv(Results_Folder + '/Balanced_dataset/ks_p_values.csv')\n","print(\"Saved KS p-values to ks_p_values.csv\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kgoO61WY06ZK"},"source":["## **3.2.3.
